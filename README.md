# Route Configuration

This repository is a lab for NCTU course "Introduction to Computer Networks 2018".

---
## Abstract

In this lab, we are going to write a Python program with Ryu SDN framework to build a simple software-defined network and compare the different between two forwarding rules.

---
## Objectives

1. Learn how to build a simple software-defined networking with Ryu SDN framework
2. Learn how to add forwarding rule into each OpenFlow switch

---
## Execution

> TODO:
> * How to run your program?
To run the program, we do the following steps:
1. Run topology 
* Run topology in one terminal first <br />
![picture](runtopofirst.JPG)
* Then, run the controller in another terminal
![picture](thencontroller.JPG)
2. Measure the bandwidth 
* Use the following iPerf commands to measure the bandwidth in your network
![picture](iperfcommand.JPG)
* Leave topo.py in one terminal first
![picture](exit.JPG)
* Then, leave SimpleController.py in another terminal
![picture](leavecontroller.JPG)
3.
> * What is the meaning of the executing command (both Mininet and Ryu controller)?
> * Show the screenshot of using iPerf command in Mininet (both `SimpleController.py` and `controller.py`)

## Description

### Tasks

> TODO:
> * Describe how you finish this work in detail

1. Environment Setup <br />
Step 1: Join this lab on GitHub Classroom <br />
Step 2: Login to container using SSH <br />
* for my case, I used Putty to access my container.
Step 3: Clone your GitHub repository <br />
Step 4: Run Mininet for testing <br />
2. Example of Ryu SDN <br />
Step 1: Login to container in two terminals <br />
Step 2: Run Mininet topology in one terminal first <br />

Step 3: Run Ryu manager with controller in anohter terminal <br />
![picture](thencontroller.JPG)
Step 4: To leave the leave the Ryu controller: <br />
* Leave topology in one terminal first
![picture](exit.JPG)
* Then, leave controller in another terminal
![picture](leavecontroller.JPG)

3. Mininet Topology

4. Ryu Controller

5. Measurement

### Discussion

> TODO:
> * Answer the following questions

1. Describe the difference between packet-in and packet-out in detail.
   
2. What is “table-miss” in SDN?
   
3. Why is "`(app_manager.RyuApp)`" adding after the declaration of class in `controller.py`?
   
4. Explain the following code in `controller.py`.
    ```python
    @set_ev_cls(ofp_event.EventOFPPacketIn, CONFIG_DISPATCHER)
    ```

5. What is the meaning of “datapath” in `controller.py`?
   
6. Why need to set "`ip_proto=17`" in the flow entry?
   
7. Compare the differences between the iPerf results of `SimpleController.py` and `controller.py` in detail.
   
8. Which forwarding rule is better? Why?
